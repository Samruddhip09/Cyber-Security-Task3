Password Complexity Checker Organization: Comillas Negras | Internship: Prodigy Infotech

This project is a Password Complexity Checker built in Python that evaluates the strength and security of user passwords.
It analyzes the password based on multiple parameters such as length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to determine how secure the password is.

The program provides instant feedback and categorizes passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong, helping users create safer and more reliable passwords.

⚙ Working Principle
The user enters a password in the program.

The tool checks for:

✅ Minimum length (8+ characters)
🔠 Uppercase and lowercase letters
🔢 Numerical digits
🔣 Special characters (like @, #, $, %)
Based on these conditions, it calculates a complexity score and provides feedback on password strength.

💡 Features
Analyzes password strength using multiple criteria.
Provides detailed feedback and improvement tips.
Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
Can be extended with a GUI for real-time password strength checking.
